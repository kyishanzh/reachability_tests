  abstract = 	 {Normalising flows (NFs) map two density functions via a differentiable bijection whose Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently. Recently, as an alternative to hand-crafted bijections, Huang et al. (2018) proposed neural autoregressive flow (NAF) which is a universal approximator for density functions. Their flow is a neural network (NN) whose parameters are predicted by another NN. The latter grows quadratically with the size of the former and thus an efficient technique for parametrization is needed. We propose block neural autoregressive flow (B-NAF), a much more compact universal approximator of density functions, where we model a bijection directly using a single feed-forward network. Invertibility is ensured by carefully designing each affine transformation with block matrices that make the flow autoregressive and (strictly) monotone. We compare B-NAF to NAF and other established flows on density estimation and approximate inference for latent variable models. Our proposed flow is competitive across datasets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider guiding denoising diffusion models with general differentiable loss functions in a plug-and-play fashion, enabling controllable generation without additional training. This paradigm, termed Loss-Guided Diffusion (LGD), can easily be integrated into all diffusion models and leverage various efficient samplers. Despite the benefits, the resulting guidance term is, unfortunately, an intractable integral and needs to be approximated. Existing methods compute the guidance term based on a point estimate. However, we show that such approaches have significant errors over the scale of the approximations. To address this issue, we propose a Monte Carlo method that uses multiple samples from a suitable distribution to reduce bias. Our method is effective in various synthetic and real-world settings, including image super-resolution, text or label-conditional image generation, and controllable motion synthesis. Notably, we show how our method can be applied to control a pretrained motion diffusion model to follow certain paths and avoid obstacles that are proven challenging to prior methods.}
